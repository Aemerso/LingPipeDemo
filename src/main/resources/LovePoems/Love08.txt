Young Peggy By Robert Burns

I.

        Young Peggy blooms our bonniest lass,
            Her blush is like the morning,
        The rosy dawn, the springing grass,
            With early gems adorning:
        Her eyes outshone the radiant beams
            That gild the passing shower,
        And glitter o'er the crystal streams,
            And cheer each fresh'ning flower.

II.

        Her lips, more than the cherries bright,
            A richer dye has graced them;
        They charm th' admiring gazer's sight,
            And sweetly tempt to taste them:
        Her smile is, as the evening mild,
            When feather'd tribes are courting,
        And little lambkins wanton wild,
            In playful bands disporting.

III.

        Were fortune lovely Peggy's foe,
            Such sweetness would relent her,
        As blooming spring unbends the brow
            Of surly, savage winter.
        Detraction's eye no aim can gain,
            Her winning powers to lessen;
        And fretful envy grins in vain
            The poison'd tooth to fasten.

IV.

        Ye powers of honour, love, and truth,
            From every ill defend her;
        Inspire the highly-favour'd youth,
            The destinies intend her:
        Still fan the sweet connubial flame
            Responsive in each bosom,
        And bless the dear parental name
            With many a filial blossom.
