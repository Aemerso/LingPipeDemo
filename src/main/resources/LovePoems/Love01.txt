    Upon Parting By Robert Herrick

    Go hence away, and in thy parting know
    'Tis not my voice but Heaven's that bids thee go;
    Spring hence thy faith, nor think it ill desert
    I find in thee that makes me thus to part.
    But voice of fame, and voice of Heaven have thundered
    We both were lost, if both of us not sundered.
    Fold now thine arms, and in thy last look rear
    One sigh of love, and cool it with a tear.
    Since part we must, let's kiss; that done, retire
    With as cold frost as erst we met with fire;
    With such white vows as fate can ne'er dissever,
    But truth knit fast; and so, farewell for ever
