            The setting dog the stubble tried,
            And snuffed the breeze with nostrils wide;
            He set - the sportsmen from behind,
            Conscious of game, the net unwind.

            A partridge, which as warder stood,
            Warned, and the covey sought the wood.
            But, ere she followed from her cover,
            Thus she discharged her mind on Rover:

            "Thou fawning slave and sneaking cheat,
            Subservient unto man's deceit!
            Disgrace unto thy honest race,
            Unto the race of dogs disgrace;
            Who ere to men they bent the knee
            Were noted for fidelity."

            The dog retorted with a sneer:
            "Since you are safe, enjoy your jeer;
            Rustic alike in kind and mind,
            And ignorant of courts refined.
            Sagacious courtiers do like me, -
            They rise to high supremacy;
            I copy them, and I inherit
            The high rewards for worth and merit."

            "I might have known," the partridge said,
            "The school where you were trained and bred;
            With a smooth brow for every crisis,
            Inherent to your master's vices.
            You came from courts: return! adieu" -
            And to her covey off she flew.
