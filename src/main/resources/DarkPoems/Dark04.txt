Shadow of Nightmare By Clark Ashton Smith

        What hand is this, that unresisted grips
         My spirit as with chains, and from the sound
         And light of dreams, compels me to the bound
        Where darkness waits with wide, expectant lips?
        Albeit thereat my footing holds, nor slips,
         The threats of that Omnipotence confound
         All days and hours of gladness, girt around
        With sense of near, unswervable eclipse.

        So lies a land whose noon is plagued with whirr
        Of bats, than their own shadows swarthier,
         Whose flight is traced on roofs of white abodes,
        Wherein from court to court, from room to room,
        In hieroglyphics of abhorrent doom,
         Is slowly trailed the slime of crawling toads.
