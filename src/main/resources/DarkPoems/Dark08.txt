Semper Idem By Madison Julius Cawein

    1

    Hold up thy head and crush
        Thy heart's despair;
    From thy wan temples brush
        The tear-wet hair.


    2

    Look on me thus as I
        Gaze upon thee;
    Nor question how nor why
        Such things can be.


    3

    Thou thought'st it love! - poor fool!
        That which was lust!
    Which made thee, beautiful,
        Vile as the dust!


    4

    Thy flesh I craved, thy face! -
        Love shrinks at this -
    Now on thy lips to place
        One farewell kiss! -


    5

    Weep not, but die! - 'tis given -
        And so - farewell! -
    Die! - that which makes death heaven,
        Makes life a hell.
